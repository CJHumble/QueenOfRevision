### An app I made in Python to work on my coding skills and to store acronyms and their meanings while revising for my DevNetSkills final exam
Made a fairly long time ago after knowing I needed to work on my Python but was stuck in tutorial hell. 
Currently can only get it to work with absolute paths which have been removed for privacy

It was set up very specifically to store acronyms I found during my studies, the meaning and an explanation,
which module it was most relevant to/where first seen, any notes (planned to be like tags), the link to the course content for that particular 
module, and any relevant diagrams or images.

It allowed you to search part or all of an acronym, or generate a list of all entries currently in the table

Current issue: when it returns multiple search matches with pictures added only the last one will show

Yes, I could have just used a database, but I had fun making something with some use
